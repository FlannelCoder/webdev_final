                   <p>
                        A big part of meteorology is looking back at history to get an idea of what current-year patterns may bring in the coming days, weeks, or months.
                        Alongside realtime analysis plots, historical plots have been created to take a look back at history, not only for forecasting, but also for research purposes.<br><br>
                        Firstly, the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA) plots shown in <a href="analysis.html">realtime analysis</a> are compatible with historical analysis.
                        This allows users to view historical SST patterns and from there can create seasonal analogs for forecasts.

                   <h1 style="font-size: xx-large;">Hurricane Analysis</h1>
                   <p>
                        In the figure above, a seasonal analysis map of the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/extremely-active-2017-atlantic-hurricane-season-finally-ends" target="_blank">2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season</a> is shown.
                        These are brand new maps, with the program for these being written only a couple of weeks ago. This new program sifts through NOAAs HURDAT database and based on user requests can plot any singular storm or hurricane season dating back to 1851.<br><br>
                        These maps are particularly helpful when looking for hurricane season analogs, and getting an idea, from historical standpoints where hurricane season activity could be elevated in any given year. Alongside that,
                        it is also fascinating to take a look back and see historical hurricane seasons such as 2017.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Another fascinating historical aspect to look at is the relationship between wind and pressure within hurricanes.
                        In the figure shown above, a graph plotting Hurricane Lees (2023) wind and pressure throughout its lifetime is shown.
                        Graphs like these are not only fascinating to look at, especially in storms such as Hurricane Patricia (2015) and Hurricane Wilma (2005), but also can be used for historical research.<br><br>

                    <p>
                        One final plot to show for historical analysis is a look at how certain years deviated from set year averages in history.
                        Similar to how Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA) maps show yearly deviation, this new deviation plot takes in a select few years, and calculates the deviation of the desired year from the given set.

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In the example above, the August-September-October global Sea Surface Temperature deviation is shown, 
                        and the comparison dataset here is years since 1991 where the Atlantic Hurricane Season ended with >=140 units of <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane2003/August/background_information.html" target="_blank">Accumulated Cyclone Energy</a> (ACE).<br><br>

                        This deviation plot alongside the wind-pressure relationship graph will soon be available via the WeatherNova Discord bot.<br>
